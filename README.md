# ML_Assignments
A collection of assignments done for the course Machine Learning @IIITD

## Assignment 1
Worked with audio, image and speech data. Performed basic data analysis and visualization.

## Assignment 2

Implemented unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms from scratch. Implemented K-means, PCA, Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression. 

Used metrics like R2 score to evaluate regression models. Used silhouette score to find best value of K in K-means clustering.

## Kaggle 1

### Dataset 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/256/daily+and+sports+activities

Description: 19 activities performed by 8 subjects for 5 mins. Total signal duration is 5 minutes. Sampling frequency is 25Hz. 

### Task
Predict the correct activity given the sensor data. There are 19 activities in total.

### Approach
Classified the activities using Kmeans and KNN. KNN gave better results.

## Kaggle 2

### Dataset
Link is given in the ipynb file.

### Task
Predict the word given the audio signal. There are 30 words in total. 

### Approach
Used MFCC features and trained multiple gmm models(30 to be precise, 1 for each class).
